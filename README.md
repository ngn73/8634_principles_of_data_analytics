## Final Note (04/05/2025):  
After submitting the final Notebook for task #10, I hope I have addressed the requirements of [Tasks Document](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/principles_of_data_analytics/tree/main/assessment/tasks.md).  
I had taken 25 credits this semester (over the recommended 15) for the part-time program, and found it very taxing on my time. **I will not do this again.**  
The 2 other 10 credit courses took up a bulk of my time (especially Databases modules  )
* Programming and Scripting
* Applied Databases

I did find the stated requirements for each task (1 -10) in this module fairly straightforward and scope of the project is relatively simple.   
With the demands of other 2 modules, and (*what I considered*) the minimal/limited requirements of this module ... I hope I have fully addressed the requirements of the final Assessment for this module 24-25: 8634 -- PRINCIPLES OF DATA ANALYTICS
